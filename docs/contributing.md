## Contribute to the project 🚀

There are many ways to contribute to the `Komiser` project.

⚠️ Before raising a PR or an issue we request that you read our [Contributing guide](https://github.com/mlabouardy/komiser/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) which applies to every Komiser GitHub repository. We have a wide range of suggestions for contributing to the project and community and only some of those involve writing code. 

If you decide to become a contributor don't hestitate to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Xz2Ru8qt), say "Hi!" 👋 in the `introductions` channel and then head over to the `contributors` section and let us know you arrived. Once we identify you as a contributor 👷, you'll be added to a private `#contributors` channel. See you there 😊

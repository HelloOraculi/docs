## Contributing to the docs

- If it takes longer than expected to get feedback from the `Oraculi` team, head over to the [Discord Server](https://discord.oraculi.io) and **ping** an Oraculi staff member either in the `#general` or `#feedback` channel, unless you are a member of the private `contributor` channel. You can always request access to this channel. 

- Once your pull request is created, an `Oraculi` reviewer will provide clear and actionable feedback to you. As the owner of the pull request, it is your responsibility to modify it to address the feedback that has been provided.

- Once the PR is approved, it will be merged to master and you will then become and official contributor, congrats!

If you are in need of any assiatance at any stage of you contributing experience please don't hesitate to reach out to anybody in the `#contributors` discord channel. Or directly to `@mlabouardy` or `@JakePage` who will always be happy to help.

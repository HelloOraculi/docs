# Design steps for Architects and Developers (Part 1)

Hey there Oraculists!🚀 

This is the first of a `3-part` installment breaking down three excellent articles by [Shane Baldacchino](https://automation.baldacchino.net/) on cloud optimisation.

Article 1 - ℹ️ [Practical design steps for Architects and Developers](https://automation.baldacchino.net/cost-optimising-your-architecture-on-azure-practical-design-steps-for-builders-to-cost-optimise-your-tech-stack/)

## TL:DR
- Architecting for Performance and Security is great, but how about we architect for `Economy`🫰
- Be sure to be `informed` about cloud updates (integrate RSS feeds to make sure they get to you) 🔔
- You have to be able to answer the questions:
- What is my **transaction cost**? 🌉
- What is my **cost to serve**? 🧫
- You `can't improve` what you `can't see`. Use the tools that suit you (eg. Cost Analytics/Explorer, Komiser, use APM, New Relic, AWS X-Ray, Azure Application Insights. Or even Azure Event Hubs, Kinesis, or Apache Kafka.) 📈
- You need to `move away` from paying **on demand**
- Have a `Reserved Instance` / `Savings Plan` % target 🎯
- Use `managed services`, engineers will have time to be more valuable elsewhere.

## Summary 📜
The public cloud brings a `magnitude of opportunities` to builders and architects. We should always try to keep the mantra `"achieve the same or better outcome at a lower cost"` at the forefront of our minds. 
By putting effort into having a **clear view** into your cloud environment at all times you will be able to better understand what **needs to be optimized**.

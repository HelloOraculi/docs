# Overview

### Hey there Oraculists!🚀 

**Welcome to the Cloud cost savings series section!**

This section is where we archive and display the weekly `Tuesday` ritual posts, which occurs on our [Discord server](https://discord.oraculi.io). These posts are arranged by cloud provider and can be found under the `Cloud Cost Savings Series` on the sidebar on the left. 

We have come to know is as the `Tuesday Cloud cost savings tips time! 💸`

### So what is it all about? 

In goes without saying that the `cloud` ☁️ is awesome in so many ways (don't get me started). But there is no way around that fact that, *if mismanaged* (which is very **easy** to do), working in the cloud can become very costly indeed 💸. 

So our **objective** with this series is to **scour** the internet each week, **find** and **distill** the enourmous amount of articles and informative resources (videos, podcasts...) out there, we go looking so you don't have to. 🔍

We understand that `cutting costs` in your cloud provider bill, can be a *daunting* task ⛰️, especailly if you are multiple dollar signs (💲💲💲💲) in the hole. With this series we want to be able to bring `actionable` and `valuabe advice` that will sometimes come from us but most times come from researching the incredible resources that the cloud community at large have produced. Which will always be rightfully **cited** and **referenced**. 

So if you are keen on **keeping your money in your own pocket** and not giving it away needlessly. Jump into one of the sections and start saving.
